Java QAP 2

This QAP is finally in a somewhat passable state, not everything is implemented but I need to move on to the final sprint.

Answers to questions:

1. Stopped keeping track after I needed to move on with other QAPs. Maybe in all took around 20 hours to do

2. Used recorded lectures

3. Asked my peer tutor but I couldn't find a good time to work with them as I kept getting new assignments (this semester has been packed lol)

4. Nope

5. Each question was only about a 6/10 in my opinion, it's just that I ran into some issues originally and then never found the time to get back into finishing it off
